Q1) Why do we implement hashCode on individual objects, instead of centrally? 
 For example, why don't we create a new class that implements hashCode for different objects, or implement hashing functions in the hash table itself?

A) We implement hashCode on individual objects instead because it is not practical to use a central hashing function because we want to make 
sure that we create a hashCode which is unique and derivable once again by using the parameters of certain objects. 

Q2) Can you create a hashing function for an object that only has transient data?  Why or why not?

A) We cannot create a hashing function for data that is transient because it isn't saved anywhere. We cannot get the data by using the
hash code because the data isn't saved. 

Q3) Let's say we have an object that has limited variability in its data - say, only 1000 possible combinations of values.  Can we create a hash code for such an object?  Why or why not?

A) We could create a hashing function but it would be inefficient to do so since its a very small amount of data. 
It would be much more practical to use a sorting algorithm. Using Hash Code for this is possible but not recommended.
