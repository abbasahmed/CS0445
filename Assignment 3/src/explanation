1) Bubble Sort test: 

Array of 10 elements: 
Moves: 45
Time: 6716

Array of 2700 elements:
Moves: 7623
Time: 377679

2) Selection Sort test:  

Array of 10 elements: 
Moves: 9
Time: 7506

Array of 2700 elements:
Moves: 99
Time: 97185

3) Merge Sort test: 

Array of 10 elements: 
Moves: 20
Time: 13433

Array of 2700 elements: 
Moves: 548
Time: 45827

1) We can see that Bubble Sort takes a lot of moves to sort and hence is inefficient when it comes to longer size of arrays.
2) Selection sort takes the least amount of moves to sort items in a longer array.
3) Merge Sort takes a reasonable amount of moves for any length of array and also takes a reasonable amount of time for each, but not to forget that it uses up a lot of memory space.
